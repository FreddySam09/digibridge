    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <br>
    
    <p>The growth of digital technology has been accompanied by growing concerns of inequality of access and information to the technology. Digital divide refers to “the gap between individuals, households, businesses and geographic areas at different socio-economic levels with regard to both their opportunities to access information and communication technologies (ICTs) and to their use of the internet for a wide variety of activities.”</p>
        
    <p>There are four levels of digital divide:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Access to computers and the internet.</li>
        <li>Skills and usage of technology.</li>
        <li>Inequality in the effects of technology access and skills for various outcomes, such as employment, education, social and political connectedness, and health.</li>
        <li>Infrastructure in terms of access to technology.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>“We focus on the users' access digital divide - the main barriers under this point are the lack of telecommunication infrastructure with sufficient reliable bandwidth, the high cost, and the inability to purchase or rent the necessary equipment. This results in a lack of access to technology.”</p>
    
    <p>As a dedicated team, we are resolute in our mission to bridge the gap created by the digital divide. In an era where technology has become an integral part of modern life, it's disheartening to witness disparities in access and opportunities. Our collective vision is to empower individuals, regardless of their socio-economic background, with the tools and resources needed to thrive in this digital age.</p>
